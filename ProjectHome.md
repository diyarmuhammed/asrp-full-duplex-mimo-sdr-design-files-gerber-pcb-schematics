Full Duplex Software Defined Radio compatible with GNU Radio + allowing the user flexibility in changing their radio through software.

A software radio is a wireless communications device that performs all of its signal processing in portable, application level software. By simply running a different program, a software radio can become a cell phone, wireless LAN, cordless phones, garage door opener or walkie-talkie. The flexibility enabled by software radio allows for faster technology tracking, since standards upgrade are simple software downloads. Software radio is a multi-disciplinary systems effort, bringing together research in digital signal processing, communications, operating systems, software engineering and algorithms.

ASRP MIMO is a daughtercardless 2x2 full duplex SDR transceiver complete with RF and DAQ subsystems on a single board.

In radio, Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output, or MIMO (commonly pronounced my-moh or me-moh), is the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance.  It is one of several forms of smart antenna technology.

Its architecture is designed for a true MIMO System. It meets the unique architecture required for MIMO systems which are not part of traditional MIMO hardware using common clock for RF subsystems where a continuous RF phase tracking is required. Coupled with these benefits, it hosts onboard RF transceiver subsystems capable of tuning frequencies from 400MHz to 4.4GHz.

SOFTWARE

AndroidSDRv1001 is a LiveDVD/USB image to support this SDR device without configuration nightmares and when connected to appropriate SDR hardware, allows for the creation of "Software Defined Radio GSM Mobile Phone Networks", for example.

This includes Android Studio 0.1.1 Build 130.687321 Environment, as well as contains:

Asterisk 1.8  http://www.asterisk.org/

GCC 4.6.3  gcc.gnu.org/‎

GNU Radio 3.4.2 + GRC http://www/gnuradio.org/‎

Java 1.7.0\_21 www.java.com/‎

OpenBTS 2.8 www.openbts.org/

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit  http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/‎

Pre-configured to work with Google Voice: just add your Google Voice Email Address & Password.  https://www.google.com/voice‎

You should be able to boot off the LiveDVD / USB image and create an SDR GSM Network in under 10 minutes cleanly.

**UHD Driver needs to be implemented to get the GNU Radio versions 3.4.2 through 3.7 applications to function**

If you are within the USA , Part 15 of the FCC Rules & Regulations allows for utilizing SDR devices as Test Equipment.  Ettus Research, PerVices, & other Software Defined Radio providers sell their products under the following (Generally Speaking):

"The USRP is sold as test equipment. If you choose to use your USRP and daughterboards to transmit using an antenna, it is your responsibility to make sure that you are in compliance with all laws for the country, frequency, and power levels in which the device is used. Additionally, some countries regulate reception in certain frequency bands. Again, it is the responsibility of the user to maintain compliance with all local laws and regulations.  http://www.ettus.com/legal/licensing "
